The `@property` decorator allows a function - really a set of functions - to behave like an attribute. `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` allow class methods to relate to their classes in special ways. `functools.lru_cache` adds caching to a function. `@contextlib.contextmanager` allows programmers to write _context managers_ using _generator functions_. Libraries like **flask** use decorators like `@app.get()` to associate Python functions with particular routes - combinations of _HTTP verbs_ and URL paths - in the resulting website. These should provide a broad overview of the sorts of things that higher-order functions, and therefore decorators, can do in Python.\n"
